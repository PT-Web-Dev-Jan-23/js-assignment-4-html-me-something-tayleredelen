                  "This piece was created during Assignment #3 Mars Rover. Anytime I would text 'Mars Rover' on my phone it would auto-correct to 'Mars River' That typo inspired me to create this piece. The POV is from a tent, looking out at kayakers in the Mars River. I used images of kayakers from a Visit Alabama pamphlet, and an image of The Red Planet from a Vouge"
