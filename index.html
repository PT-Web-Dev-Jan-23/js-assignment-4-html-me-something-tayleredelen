      <p id = "intro"> Tayler Edelen is a self taught collage artist that's been pushing papers since birth. 
         No really, as a baby she would play with magazine scraps and organize them into piles. 
         The love of repurposing has grown into an expressive medium. 
         Using magazines, glue, and tape Tayler creates art that is thought-provoking and trippy.

                     This piece was created during Assignment #3 Mars Rover.
                     Anytime I would text 'Mars Rover' on my phone it would auto-correct to 'Mars River'.
                     That typo inspired me to create this piece. 
                     The POV is from a tent, looking out at kayakers in the Mars River.
                     I used images of kayakers from a Visit Alabama pamphlet.

               When I first started the LaunchCode course, I couldn't fall asleep without seeing numbers and symbols.
               I was coding myself to sleep every night. 
               In an effort to channel these distracting thoughts I created this piece. 
               I felt like I was becoming part computer, so I made the person's head a piece of equipment.
               I added binary code behind the collage by using an I and O stamp from a letter set.

         <p class = "artDescription">
            I ordered several state brochures for free collage content. 
            I used images of a rock climber and kayaker in a nature scene with rushing waters. 
            I layered similarly colored scraps of paper around the image. 
            This piece was time consuming, but worth it. 
            The result is a textural scene that adds depth. 
            The image blends into the layered scraps seamlessly.

         I enjoy collage art because it gives me the ability to create the absurd. 
         I used an image of people jumping from a dock, and placed them above the erupting volcano. 
         This was challenging because the people are so tiny, and I didn't want to lose any details of their silhouettes. 
         When I looked at the final piece the Van Halen classic rang in my mind. 
         "Might as well jump!"
